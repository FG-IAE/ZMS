## Editor's Guide

The ZMS GUI for editors is primarily focussed on the content. To archive a design-neutral content stream
the editor produces a document as a sequence of small content-blocks. A content-block may be a text block, a link, a picture, a video or any other content class which is availabe in the right pop-up menu (called "action menu")
A content block is added by clicking on one of the listed content classes and filling the following form.
