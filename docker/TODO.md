# Goals

- [ ] one process per container
- [ ] Starting the bare docker file will give you a basic zope / zms
- [ ] everything as similar to our server deployment as possible to allow easy migration
- [ ] modern os and python
- [ ] simple to use and develop in vscode -> .devcontainer!
- [ ] all mutable data in mounted volumes
- [ ] example systemd files to run everything
  - [ ] this should show how automated container updates are done!
- [ ] example nginx config so you get the same experience as on the server

# TODOs

- [ ] Create basic Dockerfile for the project
- [ ] specialize them for zeoserver and zope
- [ ] create docker-compose file that runs each server separately
- [ ] add devcontainer.json to develop and run everything from vscode
- [ ] â€¦
